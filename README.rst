Simple python script which uses pcap, arp-scan, and `avahi <http://www.avahi.org>`__ to:

1. Find hosts that are on the LAN passively
2. Uses an arp-ping to actively identify hosts
3. Scan each host to determine open ports and services
4. Store record of hosts in JSON file, html webpage, or prints to screen

**Note:** Since IP addresses can change, the hosts are finger printed via their MAC address.

Alternatives
--------------

`Fing <http://www.overlooksoft.com/fing>`__ is a great and fast network scanner, I have
their app on my iPad. However, when using the ``fing`` commandline tool for
RPi I have noticed that there are errors in the MAC address and therefore don't trust it for this
application.

Pre-requisites::

	brew install pcap arp-scan

or

::

	sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev arp-scan

Download and unzip, then from inside the package::

	pip install -e .

Run
------------
